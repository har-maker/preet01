# dogs and cats
## If you've ever tried to share a bed with a golden retriever—or even a tiny dog—you know they take up a ton of space. Between their size, their love for stretching out into everyone's personal space, the room they need to play and exercise, and their stuff (such as a dog bed or dog toys), dogs need a solid amount of room to live a happy, healthy life.
